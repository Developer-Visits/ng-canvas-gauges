### Angular 6+ component wrapper for [@Mikhus'](https://github.com/Mikhus/canvas-gauges) canvas-gauges library.

*Note: The ng-beautiful-gauges is an updated version of the [ng-canvas-gauges](https://github.com/MeetmeLeave/ng-canvas-gauges) 
project to work with Angular 6 and greater versions. This package will remain active 
until the project is updated to work with Angular 6+ projects. A [pull request](https://github.com/MeetmeLeave/ng-canvas-gauges/pull/19) 
based on this project was submitted to ng-canvas-gauges on 20190228).*


### Getting Started
1. Install the package in your angular 6 or greater app
~~~
npm install ng-beautiful-gauges
~~~
2. Import the GaugesModule to your AppModule file and register it in the imports:

~~~javascript 
import {BrowserModule} from '@angular/platform-browser';
import {NgModule} from '@angular/core';
import {AppComponent} from './app.component';

import {GaugesModule} from 'ng-beautiful-gauges';

@NgModule({
    declarations: [
        AppComponent,
    ],
    imports: [
        BrowserModule,
        GaugesModule
    ],
    providers: [],
    bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule {
}
~~~
3. Add the linear-gauge or radial-gauge element to your template:
~~~javascript
<linear-gauge width="150" height="400"></linear-gauge>
<radial-gauge width="400" height="400"></radial-gauge>
~~~
------------------------------------------------------

    minor-ticks="5"
    stroke-ticks="true"
    ticks-width="15"
    ticks-width-minor="7.5"

    {"from": 0, "to": 50, "color": "rgba(255, 0, 0, .3)"} ]'
    color-major-ticks="#ffe66a"
    color-minor-ticks="#ffe66a"
